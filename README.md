## Purpose

Perhaps the most elegant solution for loading CAS files into your P2000T is via
a cartridge that hosts an SD-card slot. Even the smallest SD-cards have enough
capacity to store the complete P2000T tape archive. Reading from such an SD-card
is non-trivial and requires both a hardware solution to interface with the I/O
port of the P2000T as well as a software solution to navigate through the files
hosted on a FAT32 partition. This repository contains the PCB for interfacing
a P2000T with an SD-card and the necessary software routines to grab .CAS files
from said SD card and load them into memory.

> [!WARNING] 
> Since version rev6 of the PCB, the I/O port has been changed to `0x40-0x4F`,
> while older versions of the PCB use I/O port `0x60-0x6F`. Depending on which
> version of the PCB you have, you need to use the right software packages.
> The different versions are indicated by `0x40` and `0x60`.

> [!TIP]
> **Documentation**
> * Detailed documentation included how-to procedures can be found [here](https://www.philips-p2000t.nl/cartridges/sdcard-cartridge.html#sdcard-cartridge)
> * There is also a [manual in Dutch](https://github.com/ifilot/P2000T-SD-kaart-handleiding) available.

## Commands

Upon booting into the LAUNCHER application, the user interfaces with the SD-card
using a set of short commands. Below, the list of commands is provided

| **Command**         | **Description**                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ls`                | List contents of current folder                                   |
| `lscas`             | List contents of current folder, listing contents of CAS files    |
| `cd <number>`       | Change directory                                                  |
| `run <number>`      | Run .CAS file                                                     |
| `hexdump <number>`  | Performs a 120-byte hexdump of a file                             |
| `fileinfo <number>` | Provides location details of a file                               |
| `ledtest`           | Performs a quick test on the read/write LEDs                      |
| `stack`             | Show current position of the stack pointer                        |
| `dump<XXXX>`        | Perform a 120-byte hexdump of main memory starting at `0xXXXX`    |
| `romdump<XXXX>`     | Perform a 120-byte hexdump of cartridge ROM starting at `0xXXXX`  |
| `ramdump<XXXX>`     | Perform a 120-byte hexdump of cartridge RAM starting at `0xXXXX`  |

Note that `<number>` needs to replaced with the specific number of a file. Users
who are familiar with command line interfaces are probably used to specifying
filenames rather than numbers. This reason this approach was chosen is mainly
because it is simpler to program and furthermore a bit quicker to type.

## Compilation

Compilation is done using the [z88dk Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/z88dk/z88dk)
by means of `compile.sh`. To compile the launcher, run

```bash
cd src
./compile launcher
```

and for the flasher utility

```bash
cd src
./compile flasher
```
